## Moin and Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Hi, my name is Alex. I'm currently 25 years ago (based on the bold assumption I will continuously update this text) and based in Berlin, Germany. I work as a Data Analyst for [Netpoint Media](https://www.netpoint-media.de/), a German online advertising sales house focused on programmatic advertising. I hold a bachelor's degree in [*Business Administration - Digital Economy*](https://www.bht-berlin.de/en/b-dw) from the Berlin University of Applied Sciences and Technology (BHT) and I am currently enrolled in the  master's program [*Business Information Systems and Digital Transformation*](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/studium/studienangebot/masterstudium/master-a-z/wirtschaftsinformatik-und-digitale-transformation-master) at the University of Potsdam.

### Skills
- **Python:** Due to my work as Data Analyst, I'm most familiar with Python, particularly [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) and [streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit).
- **JavaScript:** I'm working on getting to know JavaScript better by diving right into projects I can think of.
- **R:** Although I prefer working in Python, I do have some basic proficiency in R.
### What I'm currently working on
1. Simple static site generator creating HTML from content provided in Markdown, as my personal continuous learning project; written in JavaScript (Node.js)
2. Holistic internal analysis tool for work; written in Python using streamlit
3. Tool for work to to clean, check, and process CSV-based contact lists to make them usable for various real-life scenarios that occur in different teams and for different purposes; written in Python using streamlit
