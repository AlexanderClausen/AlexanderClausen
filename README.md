## Moin and Welcome! 👋
Hi, my name is Alex. I'm 25 years old and based in Berlin, Germany. I work as a Data Analyst for [Netpoint Media](https://www.netpoint-media.de/), a German online advertising sales house focused on programmatic advertising. I hold a bachelor's degree in [*Business Administration - Digital Economy*](https://www.bht-berlin.de/en/b-dw) from the Berlin University of Applied Sciences and Technology (BHT) and I am currently enrolled in the  master's program [*Business Information Systems and Digital Transformation*](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/studium/studienangebot/masterstudium/master-a-z/wirtschaftsinformatik-und-digitale-transformation-master) at the University of Potsdam. I will be spending the first half of 2024 abroad at the [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/) in Ultimo, NSW, Australia.

### Skills
- **Python:** Due to my work as Data Analyst, I'm most familiar with Python, particularly [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) and [streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit).
- **JavaScript:** I work on getting to know JavaScript better by diving right into projects I can think of.
- **R:** Although I prefer working in Python, I use R for some of my quantititve academic research.
